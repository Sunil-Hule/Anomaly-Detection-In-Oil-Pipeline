# Anomaly-Detection-In-Oil-Pipeline-Data
This is a Data Science project to detect anomalies in petrol pipelines using the data generated by a device called "Pig" that travels inside pipes.

# Approach
I have applied statistical method like Inter-Quantile-Range / median*3-Standard_Deviation to detect the anomalies in the pipeline.
